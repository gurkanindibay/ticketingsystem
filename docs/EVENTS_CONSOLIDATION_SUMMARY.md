# Events Service Consolidation Summary

## Overview
The Events microservice has been successfully consolidated into the Ticketing service as they share closely related functionality. This architectural improvement reduces complexity while maintaining all functionality.

## Changes Made

### 1. Service Consolidation
- **Moved EventsController** from `TicketingSystem.Events` to `TicketingSystem.Ticketing`
- **Created IEventService interface** and **EventService implementation** in Ticketing service
- **Updated dependency injection** to register EventService in Ticketing service

### 2. Updated Service Architecture
```
Before:
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Authentication Service (Port 5001)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Events Service (Port 5002)          ‚ùå REMOVED
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Ticketing Service (Port 5003)

After:
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Authentication Service (Port 5001)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Ticketing & Events Service (Port 5002)  ‚úÖ CONSOLIDATED
```

### 3. Port Mapping Changes
- **Ticketing service** moved from `5002` ‚Üí `5002` (taking over Events port)
- **HTTP:** `http://localhost:5002`
- **HTTPS:** `https://localhost:7002`

### 4. Updated Configuration Files
- **docker-compose.yml** - Removed Events service, updated Ticketing service container name
- **TicketingSystem.sln** - Removed Events project reference
- **launchSettings.json** - Updated Ticketing service ports

### 5. Updated Testing Scripts
- **simple-test.ps1** - Updated to use consolidated endpoints
- **test-system.ps1** - Updated service health checks
- **setup-https.ps1** - Updated documentation and instructions

### 6. Enhanced Redis Service
Added missing methods to support Events functionality:
- `DeleteEventAsync()` - Remove event from cache
- `SetEventCapacityAsync()` - Set event capacity in Redis

## New API Endpoints (Ticketing Service)

### Events Management
- `GET /api/events` - Search events with filtering
- `GET /api/events/{id}` - Get event by ID
- `POST /api/events` - Create new event (Admin only)
- `PUT /api/events/{id}` - Update event (Admin only)
- `DELETE /api/events/{id}` - Delete event (Admin only)

### Ticket Operations
- `POST /api/tickets/purchase` - Purchase tickets
- `GET /api/tickets/user/{userId}` - Get user tickets
- `POST /api/tickets/cancel` - Cancel tickets
- `GET /api/tickets/queue-stats` - RabbitMQ statistics

## Swagger Documentation
Updated to reflect consolidated functionality:
- **Title:** "Ticketing System - Ticketing & Events API"
- **Description:** "Consolidated microservice for tickets and events"
- **URL:** `http://localhost:5002/swagger`

## Benefits of Consolidation

### ‚úÖ Advantages
1. **Reduced Complexity** - Fewer services to manage and deploy
2. **Shared Infrastructure** - Single Redis, database, and RabbitMQ connection
3. **Better Performance** - No inter-service communication overhead
4. **Simplified Testing** - Fewer endpoints and services to test
5. **Easier Deployment** - One less container in Docker Compose

### üîß Technical Benefits
- **Shared Caching** - Events and tickets share Redis infrastructure
- **Atomic Operations** - Event capacity updates during ticket purchases
- **Single Database Context** - Consistent transactions across events and tickets
- **Unified Logging** - All operations in single service logs

## Running the System

### Docker Compose
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

### Manual Start
```bash
# Start Authentication service
dotnet run --project src\TicketingSystem.Authentication

# Start consolidated Ticketing & Events service  
dotnet run --project src\TicketingSystem.Ticketing
```

### Available Endpoints
- **Authentication:** `http://localhost:5001/swagger`
- **Ticketing & Events:** `http://localhost:5002/swagger`

## Testing
All existing test scripts have been updated to work with the consolidated architecture:

```powershell
# Run comprehensive tests
.\test-system.ps1

# Run simple validation
.\simple-test.ps1
```

## Database Schema
No database changes were required - the consolidated service uses the same models:
- `Events` table
- `EventTickets` table  
- `EventTicketTransactions` table

## Future Considerations
This consolidation sets up the architecture for:
1. **Event-Ticket Workflows** - Streamlined operations between events and tickets
2. **Real-time Updates** - Easier capacity management and live updates
3. **Analytics** - Combined reporting across events and ticket sales
4. **Caching Strategy** - Unified caching for related data

The consolidation successfully maintains all functionality while improving the overall architecture and reducing operational complexity.
